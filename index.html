                <h3>Why should you learn to code
                </h3>
                <strong>Computer Programming is like writing and reading</strong>
                <strong>Programming makes you learn how to think and solve problem</strong>
                <strong>Learning Programming teaches you real life lessons</strong>
                <strong>Computer Programming is fun Hobby</strong>

                        <strong>Learning to code is also great practice for precise, disciplined, and abstract thinking.</strong> A program either works, or it doesn't. It could have bugs, straightforward or subtle, that require analysis and concentration.
                        But unlike math, a program does something immediately practical. (Mathematicians, please don't shoot me for saying this.)

                        <strong>Programming transforms your computer from a home appliance to a power tool.</strong> Whether you have an office job, are a student, or just go online a lot, people use computers to get stuff done. But some tedious, lengthy
                        computer tasks are so specific or context-dependent that no one has produced software to do it. Even without deep programming knowledge, coding becomes a large productivity multiplier. Computers are everywhere; they should be tools,
                        not appliances.<i>A tool is something you sharpen, an appliance is something you replace.</i>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Learning to program is great practice for learning itself.</strong> Professional software developers use Google daily to answer questions or find documentation for their work. During the course of coding you will come up
                        with several questions that will require you to seek out an answer. Googling is a skill in itself: figuring out which keywords to use, identifying useless advice and generic platitudes on content-farm sites, knowing how to ask
                        a question. (The last one is so complex it has its own These aren't arbitrary word problems or Sudoku puzzles you are answering. Learning to code involves learning how to find real help for yourself.
