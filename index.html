               <p> <strong>Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, should learn a computer language, because it teaches you how to think.</strong> It's like going to law school. 
                I don't think anybody should be a lawyer, but going to law school can actually
                be useful because it teaches you how to think in a certain way.... I view computer science as a liberal art. </p>

       
         <p>No one’s born a computer scientist, but with a little hard work, and some math and science, just about anyone can become one. And don’t let anyone tell you “You can’t. “ Whether you’re a young man or a young woman, whether you live in a city or a rural area, computers are going to be a big part of your future.
            And if you’re willing to work and study hard, that future is yours to shap.</p>

                        <strong>Learning to code is also great practice for precise, disciplined, and abstract thinking.</strong>
                        A program either works, or it doesn't. It could have bugs, straightforward or subtle, that require analysis and concentration. But
                    unlike math, a program does something immediately practical. (Mathematicians, please don't shoot me for saying this.)

                        <strong>Programming transforms your computer from a home appliance to a power tool.</strong>
                        Whether you have an office job, are a student, or just go online a lot, people use computers to get stuff done. But some tedious, lengthy
                    computer tasks are so specific or context-dependent that no one has produced software to do it. Even without deep programming knowledge, coding becomes a large productivity multiplier. Computers are everywhere; they should be tools,
                    not appliances.<i>A tool is something you sharpen, an appliance is something you replace.</i>

                        <strong>Learning to program is great practice for learning itself.</strong>
                        Professional software developers use Google daily to answer questions or find documentation for their work. During the course of coding you will come up with
                    several questions that will require you to seek out an answer. Googling is a skill in itself: figuring out which keywords to use, identifying useless advice and generic platitudes on content-farm sites, knowing how to ask a question.
